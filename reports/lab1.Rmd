## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
dados = read_csv(here("data/series_from_imdb.csv"), 
                    progress = FALSE,
                    col_types = cols(series_name = col_character(), 
                                     episode = col_character(), 
                                     url = col_character(),
                                     season = col_character())) 

series = unique(subset(dados, select=c("series_name")))

#13 Reasons Why
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
info_series <- dados %>% filter(series_name %in% c("How to Get Away with Murder", "Scandal"))

basic_statistic <- dados %>%
        group_by(series_name) %>%
        summarise(mediana = median(user_rating),
                  media = mean(user_rating),
                  maximo = max(user_rating),
                  minimo = min(user_rating))

shonda_land_s1<- info_series%>% filter(season == 1)
shonda_land_s2<- info_series%>% filter(season == 2)


ggplot(data=info_series, aes(x=season_ep, y=user_rating, group=series_name, color=series_name)) +
    geom_line()+
    geom_point() +
    facet_wrap(~ season)

p10 <- ggplot(info_series, aes(x = series_name, y = user_rating, color= series_name)) +
        geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(w = 0.4, h = 0)) + scale_color_manual(values=c("#ed3d51", "#5080ef", "#56B4E9"))
p10


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
